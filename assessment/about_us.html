          <h1 class="the-mandate">The Mandate</h1>
          <p>
            Our Mandate for ministry was received from the LORD Himself, in an
            18 hour vision. During this vision, a commission was received from
            the LORD to liberate mankind in all facets of human existence, to
            restore broken destinies, to bring healing to the infirmed. This was
            the Divine mandate received from the LORD: Now the hour has come to
            liberate the world from all oppression of the devil through the
            preaching of the word of faith, and I am sending you to undertake
            this task
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, testimonies of liberation through our messages, books, tapes,
            magazines and other periodicals are most humbling. The word of faith
            is working like fire for the liberation of mankind across the
            nations.

      <h1 class="the-mandate">12 Pillars</h1>
      <p class="pillar-paragraph">
        God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a Word of
        Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, “…if the trumpet
        give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?” (1
        Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have experienced amazing testimonies ever
        since this commission was handed down – that is over thirty years now!
        The Holy Ghost further inspired the servant of God, Dr. David Oyedepo,
        to classify the Word of Faith He has committed into his hands into the
        specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to Isaiah 40:6, “The
        voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?…” He has named these 12
        areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our Commission. We have crossed
        Jordan into power, bearing the ark of liberation. Here are the 12
        stones, after the order of Joshua 4:1-8, 20-24. Having stood firm upon
        these twelve stones! And they have resulted in breakthroughs – both for
        the ministry and all that are partakers with us, of the same grace.
