            "The pandemic continues to have an ongoing impact on our economy, 
            and particularly our SMMEs.
             We are encouraged that private sector companies like Google and others continue to support them. 
             We would like to commend Google on the economic recovery initiatives it is investing in, 
             particularly its support for job seekersâ€¦and its investments in SMMEs and education through its SMME digitisation efforts, 
             Digital Skills for Africa, Grow with Google, Google for Startups Accelerator Africa and other programmes.
              We welcome the news that Google will be launching another initiative aimed at supporting SMMEs called The Hustle Academy - an initiative supported by the Department of Small Business Development".

          "The Google Hustle Academy Program is a laudable initiative that will help improve business prospects and also create the impact we desire at the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund. I recommend this program to business owners and SMEs, to improve results and growth in Lagos business eco-system".
